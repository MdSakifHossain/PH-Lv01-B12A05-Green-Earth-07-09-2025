#### 🔰 Q1: `What is the difference between var, let, and const?`

#### Answer: 👇

well they are like 3 childrens of javascript. `var` is like the dumbest of the 3 of them.
`let` and `const` are like the next set of these siblings. let is like the successor of `var` and `const` is like, `im not gonna change my inner content, no matter what` kinda dude.

const is the unshakable or should i say its the loyal kinda guy who only have fallen for only one girl. on the other hand, `let` is like an amature when it comes to love. but, my oh my, `var` is like `i love all` kinda guy.

#### 🔰 Q2: `What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?`

#### Answer: 👇

`map()` is like the magician who takes the old clothes and perform some magic and then makes poof. A new kinda cloth with different colos.

`forEach()` is like a janitor who have no life to enjoy. he only just cleans his objective and doesnt convert anything into anything else. he just here to clean the place with no return statement.

`filter()` is like the bouncer in a night club. as a bouncer `filter()` checks for the value for this case age. if the age is less then 18 then he cant go in. just like that he kinda filters out all the minors from the clubs door.

#### 🔰 Q3: `What are arrow functions in ES6?`

#### Answer: 👇

arrow functions are like the successor with the same kinda vibe but with new and simple syntax and if theres only one line in the function then it just kinda returns automatically. this is something new compared to the traditional fucntions as we had before `ES6`.

#### 🔰 Q4: `How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?`

#### Answer: 👇

object destructuring in js after `ES6` is like a blessing from the maintainers of `JavaScript` on steriods.

with its small and simple syntax we can reduce 10 lines of code into one like just by doing the stuff with a:

```js
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
let { name, age } = person;

console.log(name); // 'John'
console.log(age); // 30
```

#### 🔰 Q5: `Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?`

#### Answer: 👇

before template strings we literally had to just do all the dirty things repeatedly with no mercy. there was no dynamic sting kinda thing in the world.

but after the template string, we can just plug in a variable like it was never a pain kinda thing. it made us feel like theres a purpose in dynamic stings and it did fullfil its promise.
